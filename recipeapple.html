		<p>My roommate shared this recipe with me, telling me it was her taste of home, 
			a flavor she has always loved when she was growing up. 
			Baking this cake was an absolute delight. With the baked apples and heavenly cinnimon, 
			my kitchen smelled like the most beaultiful day of Autumn.
			What's more, is that the cake itself tastes like a warm hug. </p>
